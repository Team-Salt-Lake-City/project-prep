# Group Project: Team Agreement
The first step in project planning is establishing a Team Agreement. This will be used as the guideline for how your team will collaborate during project week.

Projects are stressful, and can ignite emotions that otherwise wouldn’t be a problem. It’s important that the safety and security of the group comes first, and that an agreement is in place to establish expectations and accountability among the whole group.

## Planning
Schedule a 1-hour meeting for your entire project team.

Use this time to review the Team Agreement requirements below, and establish consensus on how to handle each requirement.

## Deliverable
Start a public-facing GitHub markdown file, and include the following components in your team agreement submission.
Cooperation Plan
Every person on your team is an asset. This is your chance to discover the hidden strengths and areas for growth for each team member.

## Cooperation Plan
Every person on your team is an asset. This is your chance to discover the hidden strengths and areas for growth for each team member.
Describe at least:

### What are the key strengths of each person on the team?
Ben: JS is a pretty easy language for Ben. Good at googling. If he have a structure and really solid pseudocode he can program out really functional JS. When there isn't pseudocode it's a bit more difficult. 
Cole: JS is a pretty easy language for Cole as well. Good at googling.
Tanesha: Way better at CSS than at JS, very good at visuals. Pretty good at constructors and objects. 
Eden: If he have a structure and really solid pseudocode he can program out really functional JS. When there isn't pseudocode it's a bit more difficult. Pretty okay at CSS. 


### How can you best utilize these strengths in the execution of your project?
We're going to have to have a really good structure, and a good starting point for us to continue going forward. Tanesha and Eden will take lead on CSS styling. Cole and Ben can help with the front-load of JS. We are all definitely going to work on every aspect of the project though :)

### In which professional competencies do you each want to develop greater strength?
We all want to get better at starting projects and establishing and understanding the problem domain. 

### Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand all aspects of the project, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day work?
 We can always start our day with "does anyone have any questions that you didn't get answered the day before" and the openness to be able to ask questions as they arise. As a team we can't help each other out if we don't know where we're struggling. 
(NOTE: Undoing, Redoing, Replacing, or otherwise steamrolling the project as an individual is considered to be unacceptable. Account for the inevitable divergence of ideas, execution tasks, and assignments of duties here.)

## Conflict Plan
Your team should agree on a process for handing disagreements, should they arise. It is better to have a plan in place ahead of time so you can all refer back to it when necessary.

Describe at least:

### What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?
5 minute step away, and democratic process, look at all the options decide on one, open clear communication. If we have a tie then we will use a random number generator.

### What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?
We will actively try not to do that to each other, but also don't be shy about pointing out if it's happening, and asking what we can do if someone is taking over. (what will we actually do: don't throw bottles at each other)

### How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?
We need to have open communication, and to be able to come to each other and ask questions. We are also going to establish a common practice formatting for comments within our code. 


### How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing? 
Just be upfront and communicative, let's assume that if they aren't contributing its because they are blocked. Approach this situation as "how can we help unblock you?" We're all adults and can handle feedback. This would be a good time to do a pair/mob programming session.


### How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful? 
If we can't resolve a conflict within 30 minutes we call democratic process and then another 30 minutes between us, then Audrey! Audrey come help! Bring in a third party if we can't reach a resolution. 


## Communication Plan
Before beginning to tackle the project, determine how your group will communicate with each other. This is not an individual effort. Make sure everyone feels comfortable with the identified methods of speaking up.

Describe at least:

### What hours will you be available to communicate? 
We always have our phones on us and we have slack on our phones and are open for communication. Cole and I prefer a 9-6 availability and will make exceptions. Tanesha and Ben are a bit more flexible in their timings. 

### What platforms will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)?
We will communicate via slack mostly. 

### How often will you take breaks?
As you need a breaks, take breaks. 

### What is your plan if you start to fall behind?
Start off with having our MVP be pretty low, we can scale back scope. If one part is falling behind we can start pairing up to try and push forward on that part. 

### How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend?
Slack 

### What is your strategy for ensuring everyone’s voice is heard?
Our morning meetings, checking in on where everyone is at, and a short afternoon meeting. Set goals at the morning meaning and the afternoon meeting re-asses and see if we need to scale back goals.  

### How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?
Goes back to our meetings, making sure we're getting input from every team member, make sure that everyone is involved in the design. 

## Work Plan
Explain your work plan to track whether everyone is contributing equally to all parts of the project, and that each person is working on “meaty” problems. This should prevent “lone wolf” efforts and “siloed” efforts.

NOTE: While researching and experimentation is always encouraged, writing and/or committing code to the project on your own during non-working hours or over the weekend is never acceptable. This puts the entire project at risk. Be explicit in calling out your work hours and the distribution of tasks.

Describe at least:

### How you will identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general? 
Build out a application flow chart where we can get a clear structure, triage each portion into categories of importance and help to identify which person is do which task. We are going to initial our comments, so that we can refer back to that person with questions. 

### What project management tool will be used?
GitHub 

## Presentation Deck
Make a single copy of the Presentation Deck Template. Share your copy will all team members, so everyone is working from the same file.

Link to the shared doc in your project plan.

Schedule your practice session
Work with your instructor to pre-schedule an date and time for your “practice run” of your presentation. This should either be an exact time, or a short window of time designated by your instructor. Plan for a 30-45 minute meeting during the class session before your actual presentation to allow time for both your practice run and feedback from the instructional team.

Reminder as you work on and practice your presentations:

Expressions of gratitude should be heartfelt.
When not presenting, team members should make strong eye contact with the “audience” / camera.
Be positive, no matter how tired or burned out you may feel … “Your smiles can be heard over the phone”
Git Process
Plan out what your team’s Git workflow looks like for coding tasks.

Describe at least:

### What components of your project will live on GitHub?
Everything 

### How will you share the repository with your teammates?
Organization 

### What is your Git flow?
We will have the main stage branch and each person will their own stage branch and ACP as needed. We will always pull before you push because that will ensure that whatever you are pushing up to you is the most up to date code. This will eliminate git conflicts 

### Will you be using a PR review workflow? If so, consider:
### How many people must review a PR? 
we will do this as a team in our morning meeting
### Who merges PRs?
we will do this as a team in our morning meeting
### How often will you merge? to stage branch every morning, to the main branch only when "feature complete"
### How will you communicate that it’s time to merge?
we will do this as a team in our morning meeting
