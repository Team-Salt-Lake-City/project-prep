## Group Project: Pitch Ideas
It is now time to begin preparations for your Group Project. Youâ€™ve been given groups, so the first step for group projects is to pitch ideas.

Tasks
As a group, arrange a 30-60 minute time when you can all be in the same place. Lab time is ideal for this.

There will be two phases for this: brainstorm ideas, and pitching projects.

### Brainstorming Ideas
Grab a whiteboard and brainstorm ideas. During this phase, there is no comment or criticism of ideas. Ideas should be given in the form of titles or very short phrases. If an explanation is needed, save it for the pitch round.

1. Build your own adventure 
2. Recreation of wrldle (code)
3. Code Quiz 


## Pitching a Project
Once a critical mass of ideas has been written down, the person who offered the idea will give a pitch. Each pitch may be no longer than 2 to 3 minutes. The purpose of a pitch is to sell the idea to your group mates. During this phase, questions may be asked, but the discussion should be limited. Keep it short and to the point.

At the end of the pitch, you should have formed a short list of favorites.

### Create your Pitch
Once your team had decided on 1 or 2 favorites, prepare your pitches for submission.

Each pitch should contain the following information:

Name of Project

Summary of idea.
What problem or pain point does it solve? a. Keep it high level without going into too much detail. (3-4 sentences is enough)
Minimum Viable Product (MVP) definition.
What is the minimum required for you to present on your demo day?
