Need to build logic that checks not if a letter is in the word but which index in the word the letter is. 

logic needs to check if the letter is not in the word


make each word an object
property of word is length
actual word


separate results page to store the users:
the word
amount of guesses used
this is your win%
streak we could do 

If they don't get it on the first guess we just restore the number of guesses to 0 

need variables for this current streak and best ever streak
compared every time until the current streak = best ever streak
if they lose then current streak resets to 0 and best streak ever stays the same

Making the Nav bar : hover buttons nice and simplistic and clean 
but when you hover over it make it nice and cool with free icons 

pop up to user of the word description will be a stretch goal 

store which words they've already done so that they don't get the same word in a row.
